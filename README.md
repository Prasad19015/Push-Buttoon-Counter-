# Push-Buttoon-Counter-
This project implements a Push Button Counter using an Arduino Uno, where the counter value increases each time the push button is pressed. The system reads the digital input from the button, processes it using embedded logic, and displays the count on an output device such as an LED, LCD, or Serial Monitor.
